# CSCI-599-Deep-Learning
This repository includes my solutions to the assignments of CSCI-599 Deep Learning course in University of Southern California.

## Code structure 
- CSCI599-Assignment1: contains code for the implementation of forward and backward passes, widely-used optimizers, and training procedure of a neural network.
- CSCI599-Assignment2: contains code for the implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and popular generative model, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
